# :zap: Notes CLI Manager :zap:
This app is made with [Python](https://www.python.org/) which is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.

So, with this program you can read, write and rewrite the information of a .txt document named `notes.txt`.

~~It has some bugs, but I will improve the app in other moment.~~
